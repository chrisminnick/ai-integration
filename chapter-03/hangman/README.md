# Hangman Demo

This is a browser-based Hangman game that uses a local AI language model (GPT-2 via Xenova's Transformers.js) to both select a secret word and play as an AI opponent. This demo was created for the Wiley book "A Developer's Guide to Integrating Generative AI into Applications" (2026) by Chris Minnick.

## In the book

This demo appears in Chapter 3, under the section Architectural Models > In-Browser Integration.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to this directory:

   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd chapter-03/hangman
   ```

2. **No backend or Python dependencies are required.**  
   All code runs in the browser using JavaScript and Transformers.js.

## Running the Game

Open `index.html` in your web browser.  
No server is required.

## Usage

- The game will display a blank word (e.g., `_ _ _ _ _`).
- Type a single letter in the input box and click **Guess**.
- The game will reveal any matching letters in the word.
- After your guess, the AI will also make a guess using the language model.
- The game continues until either you or the AI completes the word.

## Notes

- The secret word is chosen by the AI model (GPT-2) or from a fallback list.
- The AI's guesses are generated by prompting the language model with the current game state.
- All AI runs locally in your browser; no API key or backend is needed.
- For best results, use a modern browser and a fast computer (model loading may take some time).
